# Timestamper

Timestamper is a Pyside6 app for adding timestamps and other routine EXIF data to your film scans or any other JPEG/TIFFs that lack valuable data for digital cataloguing. The user interface is designed to rapidly assign data when elements are often related in a roll such as the same camera and lens, or sequentially offset timestamps.

Select all images in a folder of scans then use the hotkeys and preset controls to rapidly save metadata.
